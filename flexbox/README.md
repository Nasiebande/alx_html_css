Flexbox

0. Add display flex
Use the starter HTML and CSS files from this task to task 7. Copy the contents of the starter files into the files that you need to produce and make the necessary changes according to the task description.

When using display: flex; on a container, all direct children become flex-items (and no more inline or block elements).

With display flex, margins are not collapsing as they would with block items. Also remember that flexbox is 1-dimensional system (vs CSS Grid which is a 2 dimensional system)

In the /* Grid section within your CSS

Add a selector for the row class
Property: display, Value: flex
=> Now, all children from the row class are flex items

Entirely remove the row::after declaration
Remove the float: left inside [class*='col-']
=> All elements should appear same than before using the float
